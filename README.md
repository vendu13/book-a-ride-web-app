# Book-A-Ride-Web-App

Assist is a web application developed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript
The system contains a set of drivers and cars and Assist will help to simplify booking vehicles for customers. Assist can intelligently allocate a driver and vehicle to a customer based on some conditions like optimal number of seats required, vehicle class, etc. At the backend, there is a Firebase realtime database.

There is also a driver side web application which will fetch any booking assigned to the driver, who will login with an OTP to his mobile number (add +91 prefix). On ride confirmation, the application will show a route map which is working using MapBox API.

Assist also has a statistics page to analyse the earnings from each vehicle or driver.
